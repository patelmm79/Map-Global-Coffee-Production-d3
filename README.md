Summary:

My data visualization sources coffee production data by country and by year from 1990-2014
 from the International Coffee Organization, and create a world choropleth map to visualize
 coffee production over time, year-by-year.  The objective of this map is to trace the evolution 
 of coffee production by country over that time period.  


 in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
